			<string>It starts with
One thing I don&apos;t know why
It doesn’t even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It’s so unreal
Didn’t look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on but didn’t even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when...
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn&apos;t even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn&apos;t even matter
One thing, I don’t know why
It doesn’t even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I’m surprised it got so (far)
Things aren’t the way they were before
You wouldn’t even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me
In the end
You kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when...
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn’t even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn’t even matter
I&apos;ve put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There’s only one thing you should know
I&apos;ve put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There’s only one thing you should know
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn’t even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn’t even matter</string>

			<string>Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain&apos;t the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an &quot;L&quot; on her forehead

Well the years start coming and they don&apos;t stop coming
and they don&apos;t stop coming
and they don&apos;t stop coming
and they don&apos;t stop coming
and they don&apos;t stop coming
and they don&apos;t stop coming
and they don&apos;t stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn&apos;t make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what&apos;s wrong with taking the back streets?
You&apos;ll never know if you don&apos;t go
You&apos;ll never shine if you don&apos;t glow

Hey now, you&apos;re an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you&apos;re a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

It&apos;s a cool place and they say it gets colder
You&apos;re bundled up now, wait till you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water&apos;s getting warm so you might as well swim
My world&apos;s on fire, how about yours?
That&apos;s the way I like it and I never get bored

Hey now, you&apos;re an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you&apos;re a rock star, get the show on, get paid
All that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

Hey now, you&apos;re an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you&apos;re a rock star, get the show, on get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars

Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas?
I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change

Well, the years start coming and they don&apos;t stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn&apos;t make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what&apos;s wrong with taking the back streets?
You&apos;ll never know if you don&apos;t go (go!)
You&apos;ll never shine if you don&apos;t glow

Hey now, you&apos;re an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you&apos;re a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

My loneliness is killing me (and I)
I must confess, I still believe (still believe)

Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time
Oh, baby, baby
The reason I breathe is you
Boy, you got me blinded
Oh, baby, baby
There&apos;s nothing that I wouldn&apos;t do

My loneliness is killing me (and I)
I must confess, I still believe (still believe)
When I&apos;m not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time
I must confess that my loneliness
Is killing me now

			<string>Making my way down town
Walking fast
Faces pass
And I&apos;m home bound
Staring blankly ahead
Just making my way
Making a way
Through the crowd
And I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder
If I could fall
Into the sky
Do you think time
Would pass me by
&apos;Cause you know I&apos;d walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you, tonight
It&apos;s always times like these
When I think of you
And I wonder If you ever think of me
&apos;Cause everything&apos;s so wrong
And I don&apos;t belong
Living in
Your precious memory
&apos;Cause I need you
And I miss you and now I wonder
If I could fall
Into the sky
Do you think time
Would pass me by, oh
&apos;Cause you know I&apos;d walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you tonight
And I, I don&apos;t want to let you know I,
I drown in your memory I,
I don&apos;t want to let this go
I, I don&apos;t.
Making my way down town walking fast
Faces pass
And I&apos;m home bound
Staring blankly ahead
Making my way
Making a way
Through the crowd
And I still need you
And I still miss you
And now I wonder
If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time, would pass us by
&apos;Cause you know I&apos;d walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you, now
If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by
&apos;Cause you know I&apos;d walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you
If I could just hold you, tonight.

			<string>Look at this photograph
Every time I do it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey&apos;s head?
This is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneakin&apos; out
And this is where I went to school
Most of the time I had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must of done it half a dozen times
I wonder if it&apos;s too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Lot&apos;s better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn&apos;t let me in
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, God, I
Every memory of lookin&apos; out the back door
I have the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It&apos;s hard to say it
Time to say it
Good bye, good bye
Every memory of walkin&apos; out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was lookin&apos; for
It&apos;s hard to say it
Time to say it
Good bye, good bye, good bye
Remember the old arcade?
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin&apos; out
They said somebody went and burnt it down
We use to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know
We said someday we&apos;d find out how it feels
To sing to more than just a steering wheel
Kim&apos;s the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She&apos;s had a couple of kids since then
I haven&apos;t seen her since God knows when
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, God, I
Every memory of lookin&apos; out the back door
I have the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It&apos;s hard to say it
Time to say it
Good bye, good bye
Every memory of walkin&apos; out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was lookin&apos; for
It&apos;s hard to say it
Time to say it
Good bye, good bye, good bye
I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can&apos;t erase
You can&apos;t replace it
I miss it now
I can&apos;t believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it
If I could relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change
Every memory of lookin&apos; out the back door
I have the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It&apos;s hard to say it
Time to say it
Good bye, good bye
Every memory of walkin&apos; out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was lookin&apos; for
It&apos;s hard to say it
Time to say it
Good bye, good bye, good bye
Look at this photograph
Every time I do it makes me laugh
Every time I do it makes me

You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever and I&apos;ll be there
You are my love, you are my heart
And we will never, ever, ever be apart
Are we an item? Girl quit playin&apos;
We&apos;re just friends, what are you sayin&apos;
Said there&apos;s another, look right in my eyes
My first love, broke my heart for the first time
And I was like baby, baby, baby oh

Baby, baby, baby oh

I&apos;ll buy you anything
I&apos;ll buy you any ring
And I&apos;m in pieces, baby fix me
And just shake me, &apos;til you wake me from this bad dream
I&apos;m goin&apos; down, down, down, down
And I can&apos;t believe my first love won&apos;t be around
And I&apos;m like baby, baby, baby oh

Luda, when I was thirteen, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us no one could ever come above
She had me goin&apos; crazy
Oh I was starstruck
She woke me up daily
Don&apos;t need no Starbucks
She made my heart pound
And skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground
But I really wanna see her on the weekend
She know she got me dazin&apos;
&apos;Cause she was so amazin&apos;
And now my heart is breakin&apos;
But I just keep on sayin&apos;
Baby, baby, baby oh

			<string>Dog goes woof, cat goes meow.
Bird goes tweet, and mouse goes squeak.
Cow goes moo. Frog goes croak, and the elephant goes toot.
Ducks say quack and fish go blub, and the seal goes ow ow ow.
But there&apos;s one sound that no one knows...
What does the fox say?

Ring-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding!
Gering-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding!
Gering-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding!
What the fox say?
Wa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow!
Wa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow!
Wa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow!
What the fox say?
Hatee-hatee-hatee-ho!
Hatee-hatee-hatee-ho!
Hatee-hatee-hatee-ho!
What the fox say?
Joff-tchoff-tchoff-tchoffo-tchoffo-tchoff!
Joff-tchoff-tchoff-tchoffo-tchoffo-tchoff!
Joff-tchoff-tchoff-tchoffo-tchoffo-tchoff!
What the fox say?

Big blue eyes, pointy nose, chasing mice, and digging holes.
Tiny paws, up the hill, suddenly you&apos;re standing still.

Your fur is red, so beautiful, like an angel in disguise.
But if you meet a friendly horse, will you communicate by mo-o-o-o-orse, mo-o-o-o-orse, mo-o-o-o-orse?
How will you speak to that h-o-o-orse, h-o-o-orse, h-o-o-orse?
What does the fox say?!

Jacha-chacha-chacha-chow!
Jacha-chacha-chacha-chow!
Jacha-chacha-chacha-chow!
What the fox say?
Fraka-kaka-kaka-kaka-kow!
Fraka-kaka-kaka-kaka-kow!
Fraka-kaka-kaka-kaka-kow!
What the fox say?
A-hee-ahee ha-hee!
A-hee-ahee ha-hee!
A-hee-ahee ha-hee!
What the fox say?
A-oo-oo-oo-ooo!
Woo-oo-oo-ooo!
What does the fox say?!

The secret of the fox, ancient mystery.
Somewhere deep in the woods, I know you&apos;re hiding.
What is your sound? Will we ever know?
Will always be a mystery what do you say?

You&apos;re my guardian angel hiding in the woods.
What is your sound? 
A-bubu-duh-bubu-dwee-dum a-bubu-duh-bubu-dwee-dum
Will we ever know? 
A-bubu-duh-bubu-dwee-dum
I want to, I want to, I want to know! 
A-bubu-duh-bubu-dwee-dum
Bay-buh-day bum-bum bay-dum

No fighting
We got the refugees up in here (no fighting)
No fighting
Shakira, Shakira
I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man wants to speak Spanish
Como se llama (si)
Bonita (si)
Mi casa (Shakira Shakira), su casa
Oh baby when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise (si) and keep on (si)
Reading the signs of my body (uno, dos, tres, cuatro)
And I&apos;m on tonight you know my hips don&apos;t lie
And I&apos;m starting to feel it&apos;s right
All the attraction, the tension
Don&apos;t you see baby, this is perfection
Hey Girl, I can see your body moving
And it&apos;s driving me crazy
And I didn&apos;t have the slightest idea
Until I saw you dancing
And when you walk up on the dance floor
Nobody cannot ignore
The way you move your body, girl (just move)
And everything so unexpected, the way you right and left it
So you can keep on shaking it
I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man wants to speak Spanish
Como se llama (si)
Bonita (si)
Mi casa (Shakira Shakira), su casa
Oh baby when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise (si) and keep on (si)
Reading the signs of my body (no fighting)
And I&apos;m on tonight you know my hips don&apos;t lie (no fighting)
And I am starting to feel you boy
Come on lets go, real slow
Don&apos;t you see baby asi es perfecto
I know I am on tonight
My hips don&apos;t lie and I am starting to feel it&apos;s right
All the attraction, the tension
Don&apos;t you see baby, this is perfection (Shakira, Shakira)
Oh boy, I can see your body moving
Half animal, half man
I don&apos;t, don&apos;t really know what I&apos;m doing
But you seem to have a plan
My will and self restraint
Have come to fail now, fail now
See, I am doing what I can, but I can&apos;t so you know
That&apos;s a bit too hard to explain
Baila en la calle de noche
Baila en la calle de día
Baila en la calle de noche
Baila en la calle de día
I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man wants to speak Spanish
Como se llama (si)
Bonita (si)
Mi casa (Shakira Shakira), su casa
Oh baby when you talk like that
You know you got me hypnotized
So be wise and keep on
Reading the signs of my body
Señorita,
Feel the conga, let me see you move like you come from Colombia
Mira en Barranquilla se baila así, say it!
En Barranquilla se baila así
Yeah, she&apos;s so sexy every man&apos;s fantasy a refugee
Like me back with the Fugees from a 3rd world country
I go back like when Pac carried crates
For Humpty Humpty we need a whole club dizzy
Why the CIA wanna watch us? Colombians and Haitians
I ain&apos;t guilty, it&apos;s a musical transaction
No more do we snatch ropes
Refugees run the seas &apos;cause we own our own boats (no fighting)
I&apos;m on tonight
My hips don&apos;t lie and I am starting to feel you boy
Come on lets go, real slow
Baby like this is perfecto (no fighting)
Oh, you know I am on tonight
My hips don&apos;t lie and I am starting to feel it&apos;s right
The attraction
The tension
Baby, like this is perfection
No fighting
No fighting

			<string>I threw a wish in the well
Don&apos;t ask me I&apos;ll never tell
I looked at you as it fell
And now you&apos;re in my way
I trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn&apos;t looking for this
But now you&apos;re in my way
Your stare was holding
Ripped jeans
Skin was showing
Hot night
Wind was blowing
Where you think you&apos;re going baby?
Hey I just met you
And this is crazy
But here&apos;s my number
So call me maybe
It&apos;s hard to look right at you baby
But here&apos;s my number
So call me maybe
Hey I just met you
And this is crazy
But here&apos;s my number
So call me maybe
And all the other boys
Try to chase me
But here&apos;s my number
So call me maybe
You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all
But still you&apos;re in my way
I beg and borrow and steal
At first sight and it&apos;s real
I didn&apos;t know I would feel it
But it&apos;s in my way
Your stare was holding
Ripped jeans
Skin was showing
Hot night
Wind was blowing
Where you think you&apos;re going baby?
Hey I just met you
And this is crazy
But here&apos;s my number
So call me maybe
It&apos;s hard to look right at you baby
But here&apos;s my number
So call me maybe
Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
I missed you so so bad
Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
And you should know that
I missed you so so bad, bad, bad, bad....
It&apos;s hard to look right at you baby
But here&apos;s my number
So call me maybe
Hey I just met you
And this is crazy
But here&apos;s my number
So call me maybe
And all the other boys
Try to chase me
But here&apos;s my number
So call me maybe
Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
I missed you so so bad
Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
And you should know that
So call me, maybe

Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye

Don&apos;t tell me you&apos;re too blind to see
Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you

You used to, you used to
Yeah

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city,
You got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out
&apos;Cause ever since I left the city,
you started wearing less and goin&apos; out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin&apos; with some girls I&apos;ve never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me we just don&apos;t get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don&apos;t belong
Ever since I left the city,
you, you got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hanging with some girls I&apos;ve never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you&apos;re bendin&apos; over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you&apos;re rollin&apos; up a backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin&apos; nasty for someone else
You don&apos;t need no one else
You don&apos;t need nobody else, no
Why you never alone
Why you always touching road
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
You was in a zone, yeah
You should just be yourself
Right now, you&apos;re someone else

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city

			<string>How can you see into my eyes, like open doors
Leading you down into my core
Where I&apos;ve become so numb, without a soul
My spirit&apos;s sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home
Wake me up, wake me up inside I can&apos;t wake up,
Wake me up inside, save me,
Call my name and save me from the dark, wake me up
Bid my blood to run, I can&apos;t wake up
Before I come undone, save me
Save me from the nothing I&apos;ve become
Now that I know what I&apos;m without
You can&apos;t just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real, bring me to life
Wake me up, wake me up inside I can&apos;t wake up,
Wake me up inside, save me,
Call my name and save me from the dark, wake me up
Bid my blood to run, I can&apos;t wake up
Before I come undone, save me
Save me from the nothing I&apos;ve become
Bring me to life, I&apos;ve been living a lie
There&apos;s nothing inside, bring me to life
Frozen inside without your touch
Without your love, darling
Only you are the life among the dead
All this time, I can&apos;t believe I couldn&apos;t see
Kept in the dark, but you were there in front of me
I&apos;ve been sleeping a thousand years it seems
I&apos;ve got to open my eyes to everything
Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul
Don&apos;t let me die here
There must be something wrong, bring me to life
Wake me up, wake me up inside I can&apos;t wake up,
Wake me up inside, save me,
Call my name and save me from the dark, wake me up
Bid my blood to run, I can&apos;t wake up
Before I come undone, save me
Save me from the nothing I&apos;ve become
Bring me to life, I&apos;ve been living a lie, there&apos;s nothing inside
Bring me to life

			<string>spaghetti</string>
			<key>Lyrics</key>
			<string>Look, if you had mom&apos;s spaghetti,
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
Yo
His palms spaghetti, knees weak, arms spaghetti
There&apos;s vomit on his sweater spaghetti, mom&apos;s spaghetti
He&apos;s nervous, but on the surface he looks calm spaghetti to drop bombs,
But he keeps on spaghetti what he wrote down,
The whole crowd goes spaghetti
He opens his mouth, but spaghetti won&apos;t come out
He&apos;s choking how, everybody&apos;s joking now
spaghetti run out, time&apos;s up, over, bloah!
Snap back to spaghetti, Oh there goes spaghetti
Oh, there goes spaghetti, bloah
He&apos;s so mad, but he won&apos;t give up spaghetti, no.
He won&apos;t have it, he knows he keeps on forgetting
that mom&apos;s spaghetti&apos;s dope
He knows that but he&apos;s broke
He&apos;s so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to his mom&apos;s spaghetti, that&apos;s when it&apos;s
Back to the lab again, yo
This whole spaghetti
He better go capture spaghetti and hope it don&apos;t pass him
You better lose yourself in mom&apos;s spaghetti, it&apos;s ready
you better never let it go(go)
You only get one spaghetti, do not miss your chance to blow
cause spaghetti comes once in a lifetime yo
You better lose yourself in mom&apos;s spaghetti, it&apos;s ready
you better never let it go(go)
You only get one spaghetti, do not miss your chance to blow
cause spaghetti comes once in a lifetime yo
(You better)
The soul&apos;s escaping, through this hole that is gaping
mom&apos;s spaghetti&apos;s mine for the taking
Make me spaghetti, as we move toward a new world order
A normal sweater is boring, but mom&apos;s spaghetti&apos;s close to post mortem
It only grows harder, spaghetti grows hotter
He vomits all over. spaghetti&apos;s all on him
Coast to coast shows, he blows his own daughter
He only grows harder, only grows hotter
He goes home and barely knows his own mom&apos;s spaghetti
there&apos;s vomit on his mom&apos;s spaghetti
His hoes don&apos;t want him no more, he&apos;s cold spaghetti
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows man
he knows his palms are sweaty ope hes calm and ready ope
and unfolds I suppose it&apos;s old spaghetti
chewed up and spit out he&apos;s chokin now
You better lose yourself in mom&apos;s spaghetti, it&apos;s ready
you better never let it go(go)
You only get one spaghetti, do not miss your chance to blow
cause spaghetti comes once in a lifetime yo
You better lose yourself in mom&apos;s spaghetti, it&apos;s ready
you better never let it go(go)
You only get one spaghetti, do not miss your chance to blow
cause spaghetti comes once in a lifetime yo
(You better)
No more games, I&apos;ma change what you call spaghetti
Tear this motherfucking roof off like two mom&apos;s spaghettis
I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed spaghetti
chewed up and spit out and there&apos;s vomit on his sweater
But I kept chewin and stepped right into the next cypher
Hold your nose cause here goes the damn diaper
All the vomit inside amplified by the fact
That I keep on forgetting to make spaghetti
And I can&apos;t provide the right type of spaghetti for my family
Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don&apos;t buy spaghetti
And it&apos;s no movie, there&apos;s no mom&apos;s spaghetti, this is my life
And these palms are so sweaty, and i&apos;m so hard
My seed&apos;s escaping through this hole that is gaping
caught up between being a father and a prima donna
Baby vomit&apos;s on his sweater already
Mom&apos;s spaghetti he&apos;s nervous
bloah another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point, I&apos;m like a mom
I&apos;ve got to formulate spaghetti or I end up in jail or shot
spaghetti is my only motherfucking option, vomit&apos;s not
Mom, I love you, but this vomit&apos;s got to go
ope ope, led de dome de dome led de dome de dome
So here I go it&apos;s my shot.
this may be the only mom&apos;s spaghetti that I got
You better lose yourself in mom&apos;s spaghetti, it&apos;s ready
you better never let it go(go)
You only get one spaghetti, do not miss your chance to blow
cause spaghetti comes once in a lifetime yo
You better lose yourself in mom&apos;s spaghetti, it&apos;s ready
you better never let it go(go)
You only get one spaghetti, do not miss your chance to blow
cause spaghetti comes once in a lifetime yo
(You better)
Mom&apos;s Spaghetti
You can do anything man

And there like,

Damn right its better than yours,

The thing that makes me,
What the guys go crazy for.
They lose their minds,
The way I wind,

Once you get involved,
Everyone will look this way-so,
You must maintain your charm,
Same time maintain your halo,
Just get the perfect blend,
Plus what you have within,
Then next his eyes are squint,
Then he&apos;s picked up your scent,
Lala-lalala,
Warm it up,

The boys are waiting,
My milk shake brings all the boys to the yard,
And there like,
Its better than yours,
Damn right its better than yours,
I can teach you,
But I have to charge.

			<string>He was a boy.
She was a girl.
Can I make it anymore obvious?
He was a punk.
She did ballet.
What more can I say?
He wanted her.
She&apos;d never tell.
Secretly she wanted him as well.
And all of her friends stuck up their nose.
They had a problem with his baggy clothes.

He was a skater boy.
She said, &quot;See ya later, boy.&quot;
He wasn&apos;t good enough for her.
She had a pretty face but her head was up in space.
She needed to come back down to earth.

Five years from now, she sits at home feeding the baby.
She&apos;s all alone.
She turns on TV and guess who she sees?
Skater boy rockin&apos; up MTV.
She calls up her friends.
They already know.
And they&apos;ve all got tickets to see his show.
She tags along,
Stands in the crowd,
Looks up at the man that she turned down.

He was a skater boy.
She said, &quot;See ya later, boy.&quot;
He wasn&apos;t good enough for her.
Now he&apos;s a superstar
Slammin&apos; on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he&apos;s worth?

He was a skater boy.
She said, &quot;See ya later, boy.&quot;
He wasn&apos;t good enough for her.
Now he&apos;s a superstar
Slammin&apos; on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he&apos;s worth?

Sorry, girl, but you missed out.
Well, tough luck, that boy&apos;s mine now.
We are more than just good friends.
This is how the story ends.
Too bad that you couldn&apos;t see...
See the man that boy could be.
There is more than meets the eye,
I see the soul that is inside.

He&apos;s just a boy, and I&apos;m just a girl.
Can I make it anymore obvious?
We are in love.
Haven&apos;t you heard how we rock each other&apos;s world?

I&apos;m with the skater boy.
I said, &quot;See ya later, boy.&quot;
I&apos;ll be backstage after the show.
I&apos;ll be at the studio singing the song we wrote
About a girl you used to know.

I&apos;m with the skater boy.
I said, &quot;See ya later, boy.&quot;
I&apos;ll be backstage after the show.
I&apos;ll be at the studio singing the song we wrote

			<string>We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you wreck me
I put you high up in the sky
And now, you’re not coming down
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And now, we’re ashes on the ground
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can’t live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you wreck me
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
And instead of using force
I guess I should’ve let you in
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
I guess I should’ve let you in
Don’t you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me

			<string>Because you know I&apos;m all about that bass,
&apos;Bout that bass, no treble
I&apos;m all &apos;bout that bass, &apos;bout that bass, no treble
I&apos;m all &apos;bout that bass, &apos;bout that bass, no treble
I&apos;m all &apos;bout that bass, &apos;bout that bass
Yeah it&apos;s pretty clear, I ain&apos;t no size two
But I can shake it, shake it like I&apos;m supposed to do
&apos;Cause I got that boom boom that all the boys chase
All the right junk in all the right places
I see the magazines working that Photoshop
We know that shit ain&apos;t real
Come on now, make it stop
If you got beauty beauty just raise &apos;em up
&apos;Cause every inch of you is perfect
From the bottom to the top
Yeah, my momma she told me don&apos;t worry about your size
She says, boys they like a little more booty to hold at night
You know I won&apos;t be no stick-figure, silicone Barbie doll,
So, if that&apos;s what&apos;s you&apos;re into
Then go ahead and move along
Because you know I&apos;m all about that bass,
&apos;Bout that bass, no treble
I&apos;m all &apos;bout that bass, &apos;bout that bass, no treble
I&apos;m all &apos;bout that bass, &apos;bout that bass, no treble
I&apos;m all &apos;bout that bass, &apos;bout that bass
I&apos;m bringing booty back
Go ahead and tell them skinny bitches Hey
No, I&apos;m just playing I know you think you&apos;re fat,
But I&apos;m here to tell you that,
Every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top
Yeah, my momma she told me don&apos;t worry about your size
She says, boys they like a little more booty to hold at night
You know I won&apos;t be no stick-figure, silicone Barbie doll,
So, if that&apos;s what&apos;s you&apos;re into
Then go ahead and move along
Because you know I&apos;m all about that bass,
&apos;Bout that bass, no treble
I&apos;m all &apos;bout that bass, &apos;bout that bass, no treble
I&apos;m all &apos;bout that bass, &apos;bout that bass, no treble
I&apos;m all &apos;bout that bass, &apos;bout that bass
Because you know I&apos;m all about that bass,
&apos;Bout that bass, no treble

			<string>The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation,
And it looks like I&apos;m the queen.

The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Couldn&apos;t keep it in, heaven knows I tried!

Don&apos;t let them in, don&apos;t let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don&apos;t feel, don&apos;t let them know
Well, now they know!

Let it go, let it go
Can&apos;t hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door!

I don&apos;t care
What they&apos;re going to say
Let the storm rage on,
The cold never bothered me anyway!

It&apos;s funny how some distance
Makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me
Can&apos;t get to me at all!

It&apos;s time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me I&apos;m free!

Let it go, let it go
I am one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
You&apos;ll never see me cry!

Here I stand
And here I&apos;ll stay
Let the storm rage on!

My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I&apos;m never going back,
The past is in the past!

Let it go, let it go
And I&apos;ll rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go
That perfect girl is gone!

Here I stand
In the light of day
Let the storm rage on,
The cold never bothered me anyway!

			<string>It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes, uh uh, uh uh.
It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers, uh uh, uh uh.

Yeah,
We&apos;re happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
It&apos;s miserable and magical.
Oh, yeah
Tonight&apos;s the night when we forget about the deadlines
It&apos;s time

Uh oh!
I don&apos;t know about you
But I&apos;m feeling 22
Everything will be alright
If you keep me next to you
You don&apos;t know about me
But I&apos;ll bet you want to
Everything will be alright
If we just keep dancing like we&apos;re
22, ooh-ooh
22, ooh-ooh

It seems like one of those nights,
This place is too crowded.
Too many cool kids, uh uh, uh uh (who&apos;s Taylor Swift anyway, ew?)
It seems like one of those nights,
We ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming
Instead of sleeping.

Yeah,
We&apos;re happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way
It&apos;s miserable and magical.
Oh, yeah
Tonight&apos;s the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It&apos;s time

Uh oh! (hey!)
I don&apos;t know about you
But I&apos;m feeling 22
Everything will be alright
If you keep me next to you
You don&apos;t know about me
But I&apos;ll bet you want to
Everything will be alright (alright)
If we just keep dancing like we&apos;re
22, ooh-ooh (oh, oh, oh)
22, ooh-ooh
I don&apos;t know about you
22, ooh-ooh
22, ooh-ooh

It feels like one of those nights,
We ditch the whole scene.
It feels like one of those nights,
We won&apos;t be sleeping.
It feels like one of those nights,
You look like bad news.
I gotta have you,
I gotta have you.

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ye-e-e-e-eah, hey
I don&apos;t know about you (I don&apos;t know about you)
But I&apos;m feeling 22
Everything will be alright
If you keep me next to you
You don&apos;t know about me (you don&apos;t know about me)
But I&apos;ll bet you want to
Everything will be alright
If we just keep dancing like we&apos;re
22, ooh-ooh
22, ooh-ooh
22, ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah
22, ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah

It feels like one of those nights,
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights,
We won&apos;t be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights,
You look like bad news,
I gotta have you,
I gotta have you.

			<string>When your legs don&apos;t work like they used to before
And I can&apos;t sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?

And, darling, I will be loving you &apos;til we&apos;re 70
And, baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I&apos;m thinking &apos;bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me—I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So, honey, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I&apos;m thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair&apos;s all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don&apos;t remember my name
When my hands don&apos;t play the strings the same way (mmm...)
I know you will still love me the same

&apos;Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it&apos;s evergreen
And, baby, your smile&apos;s forever in my mind and memory
I&apos;m thinking &apos;bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it&apos;s all part of a plan
Well, I&apos;ll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you&apos;ll understand

That, baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
Thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are (oh, oh)

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lo-ud

So, baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh, darling, place your head on my beating heart
I&apos;m thinking out loud
But maybe we found love right where we are
Oh, baby, we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are
